To create a function to generate a report based on shape files at different levels- FSA/DA

Where the input will be any shapefile generated manually/ extracted from a third party with the CRS- WGS84, and the output will be a pdf report with a total area in km2, postal codes by area/share as a visualization, type of population within each postal code- from prizm segment created by Environics.
